Log on to your financial institution's site and look for a \"Quicken\" export or a \"Quicken Web Connect\" option. I think these both render a .QFX file.\n\nIn Quicken, select the account to which you want to import the data. Then from the FILE pulldown, choose IMPORT. If you are lucky, this will do the trick, but there are several gotchas.\n\nIf this is a first-time import to this account, Quicken may ask you to establish a link between the import file and an existing Quicken account. Even though you've already implicitly declared the account to which you want to import, Quicken may ignore this and ask you to associate an account with the file. Usually it should find the right account. In any case, make sure select the \"link\" option from the dialog box if this happens, and link to the account of interest. If you select the \"add\" option, it will create a new account. This is not usually what you want, but sometimes it's necessary to use the \"add\" option, to create a new account, and then to manually move the imported records to the account of interest, and then delete the new account.\n\nIf you find yourself needing to move records from a new temp account into a target account, do it as follows:\n\nSelect the new account. Select the records of interest. Assuming this is all records, you can do it with command-A. Then drag and drop the selected records over the target account in the left-hand account-listing panel.\n\nIf you have already had several failed attempts at import, Quicken may not present you with the option to import to a new account. In order to restore this option, you need to go to the target account and make it forget that any import was ever associated with it. Select the account of interest, then select \"Settings\" from the \"Accounts\" pulldown. At the bottom of the dialog, uncheck \"I want to download transactions\" and confirm this change. This should make Quicken forget any associated downloads.\n","created_at":"2015-04-01T14:40:12Z","height":426.4,"id":146,"parent_id":143,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-01T17:41:06Z","width":600.0},{"content":"Personal","created_at":"2015-04-01T15:20:02Z","height":25.0,"id":147,"parent_id":1299,"predecessor_id":236,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-07-03T15:31:13Z","width":59.0},{"content":"Music Composition","created_at":"2015-04-01T15:20:13Z","height":25.0,"id":148,"parent_id":1282,"predecessor_id":1283,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-07-03T14:58:23Z","width":136.0},{"content":"Boot Scootin' Baby","created_at":"2015-04-01T15:20:23Z","height":25.0,"id":149,"parent_id":148,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.75,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-01T17:42:43Z","width":144.0},{"content":"(12 bar blues count.)\nMy Baby likes to work hard,\nLikes to work all day.\nShe's a boot scootin' Baby,\nGot no time to play\nWith her Sweetheart.\nShe's just a scootin' that boot all day.\nShe's my boot scootin' baby\nAnd I miss her when she's gone away.","created_at":"2015-04-01T15:20:40Z","height":93.8199,"id":150,"parent_id":149,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":156,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-01T17:42:46Z","width":353.615},{"content":"Select the account of interest.

Part of cooperation is the logistical requirement of coordination. Say the team wants to build a house. Cooperation requires detailed agreement, such as: we'll build the house out of wood, not adobe, and I'll steady this particular plank right now so that you can pound nails into it.\n\n- Communication: when the team is small, communication can be ad-hoc, because the n^2 demand for team communication places no burden. As the team grows from 10 to 100, it needs to sub-organize itself into multiple teams, probably hierarchically, though not necessarily, and there need to be proper communication channels between sub-teams. Communication is necessary for both cooperation agreement and coordination. The fact that a single human cannot meet individually with 100 others is why this becomes challenging as team size grows. Some people think that as team size grows, you just need smarter people and that process is a panacea. In fact, these people are dead wrong. Even the smartest humans cannot handle the n^2 demands of communication, and the imposition of structure and process are the only effective means to reduce the complexity back down to human-sized manageability.\n\n- Conflict Resolution: What happens when team member A want to build the house using adobe, not wood, and team member B wants to use wood? If they cannot agree, the team dissolves. Teams need an agreed method of conflict resolution. Typically this is achieved via the imposition of hierarchy: a higher-level individual makes the decision, and both sides agree to abide by it. As teams grow from 10 to 100 to 1000, the probability of conflict goes from near zero to near one, and effective means of conflict resolution are paramount. One sub-goal is not merely to move forward, but to do so in a way that leaves the conflict's losers still feeling part of the team.\n\n","created_at":"2015-04-07T18:11:01Z","height":339.182,"id":199,"parent_id":198,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":265,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-05T18:15:51Z","width":607.182},{"content":"Conflict And Passive Agressive Behavior","created_at":"2015-04-07T18:19:06Z","height":25.0,"id":200,"parent_id":197,"predecessor_id":198,"rank":0.75,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-07T18:19:31Z","width":312.0},{"content":"Passive-aggressive behavior is the easiest way for an individual to defect from cooperation in a large organization.

An entire group or sub-organization may defect for similar reasons.

Even programs themselves are data structures. The world of information is a world of datastructures. The datastructure is the shell or body that contains the information.\n\nWe seek a (near) universal datastructure: one capable of representing (almost) any kind of data. For example, XML might be universal. And json might also be. Both are flexible formats for representing almost any kind of data. We focus on collaboration: datastructures that can be contributed to a common area, then used, copied, and modified by others.\n\nLet's consider a tree as the basis for our universal, self-extensible data structure. A tree has a unique root node. Each node has 0 or more ordered child nodes. Each node has a type. The type of the node determines how it and all the nodes below it are interpreted.\n\nEvery type is owned by the human creator of the type. To begin with, our tree system has some system-owned types defined. These allow newcomers to do basic things and they establish the basic functionality of the tree system, including its own extensibility. Newcomers can create and own their own types. There is nothing special about the system-owned types, except the fact that they come ready out-of-the-box and enable others to use and extend the system.\n\nEach type can define its own syntax-checking functionality. For example, if a node of type \"outline\" requires a single child of type \"header\", this can be enforced in the definition of the \"outline\" type. Until the node receives a child of this type, it won't \"compile\".\n\nQuestion: do we want links of different types too? If so, then, rather than defining a node to be of type \"header\", we could have a link of type \"header\" to a node of type \"text\".

In truth, this is a subtler issue, and it may well be discernible at a \"syntactic\" or \"topological\" level, by looking at complexity, at the number of parameters at the interfaces between modules.\n\nThe concept of SRP is that a class, method, module, etc., should be responsible for a single, well-defined bit of behavior. That makes perfect sense when written in English, but how does one discern where one responsibility becomes two or more? \n\nConsider CRUD operations on a Car object. We might have a Car class that allows us to create, read, update, and delete cars. Is that a single responsibility? Yes, if you consider its job to manipulate cars. But \"no\" if you consider that CRUD has 4 distinct components. Now each of these 4 components will be written using a distinct method, so SRP applies again at the method level, but clearly the Car class embodies more than just one single piece of functionality. \n\nIn fact, we put the four CRUD actions together because they are tightly coupled in some sense. Can we make that sense explicit?\n\nSome notions that may help: Each of the four CRUD actions represents a complete, atomic action. They represent stable building blocks for our system. After any one of them is performed, the system is in a stable, consistent state. If you take a transactional approach and think of the environment as a big complex of component objects which get transitioned from one valid state to the next using actions, then, at the very least, SRP dictates that each of these transitions should be the responsibility of one single, separate, piece of code. Thus, each of the CRUD actions should be the responsibility of a single method.\n\nBut, it doesn't tell us how to group the methods. Why should the four CRUD actions of a car be pulled together into a Car class? Maybe we should put all the C methods together in a \"CreateObject\" class, and all the R methods together in a \"ReadObject\" class. And, indeed, there may well be a layer of our software that has precisely these method names!\n\nBut it still wouldn't make sense not to have a Car abstraction. Why not? Most systems have lots of entities. If we decided to delineate just 4 main entities: one for handling each of C, R, U, D, then each of these classes would grow as we added new entity types. Further, every time you add an entity type, you need to make modifications to each of the 4 classes: they are interdependent! This kind of interdependency  we seek to avoid. It's a source of errors: what if you forget to update one of the other classes? What if one of the other classes is owned and controlled by a different development group?\n\nSo, here we have our first structural, or topological reason to prefer a Car class to four C, R, U, D classes, even though, from the point of view of SRP, they may both seem equally valid. The reason involves the way in which the software is likely to change: we are very likely to add more entities to the system like Cars: Boat, Plane, Bicycle, etc. We are far less likely to add more actions to the C, R, U, D menu. And, in fact, each of the transportation entities is likely to have its own specialized methods.","created_at":"2015-05-15T15:20:40Z","height":111.778,"id":297,"parent_id":296,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-15T15:32:29Z","width":330.778},{"content":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)","created_at":"2015-05-15T15:56:11Z","height":25.0,"id":298,"parent_id":256,"predecessor_id":296,"rank":0.875,"successor_id":299,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-08T15:01:43Z","width":472.0},{"content":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)","created_at":"2015-05-15T15:56:22Z","height":25.0,"id":299,"parent_id":256,"predecessor_id":298,"rank":0.9375,"successor_id":300,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-08T15:01:48Z","width":472.0},{"content":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship","created_at":"2015-05-15T15:59:15Z","height":25.0,"id":300,"parent_id":256,"predecessor_id":299,"rank":0.96875,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-08T15:01:51Z","width":408.0},{"content":"GitHub","created_at":"2015-05-18T21:17:51Z","height":25.0,"id":301,"parent_id":284,"predecessor_id":285,"rank":0.75,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-22T17:10:59Z","width":48.0},{"content":"git clone git@github.com:MoveInc/map.git","created_at":"2015-05-18T21:17:59Z","height":48.7778,"id":302,"parent_id":301,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-20T20:00:38Z","width":294.778},{"content":"GitHub","created_at":"2015-05-20T20:00:42Z","height":25.0,"id":303,"parent_id":356,"predecessor_id":1079,"rank":4.58497e-10,"successor_id":1051,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-24T15:14:59Z","width":48.0},{"content":"Clone a repository\n\ngit clone git@github.com:MoveInc/map.git","created_at":"2015-05-20T20:00:47Z","height":64.7778,"id":304,"parent_id":303,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-20T20:01:18Z","width":297.778},{"content":"javascript","created_at":"2015-05-20T22:45:00Z","height":48.7778,"id":305,"parent_id":131,"predecessor_id":266,"rank":0.9375,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-21T15:21:58Z","width":98.7778},{"content":"http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html","created_at":"2015-05-20T22:45:05Z","height":48.7778,"id":306,"parent_id":305,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-20T22:45:14Z","width":444.778},{"content":"The current web is a personal publishing dream, but we have only google to tie it all together in an ad hoc fashion.

This is a terrible way to do it, but sometimes this way is useful.\n\nOne could break down by composition: animal / vegetable / mineral, or by academic discipline: math, science, art, and so on.\n\nFor a given focus area, such as \"academics\", there is generally one preferred way of creating the taxonomy, e.g. \"art\", \"science\", \"math\", \"history\"; however, even here this is not necessarily the case.

are now on the threshold of a change in the mechanism of human evolution: from geologically slow processes outlined by Darwin to an exponentially fast process driven by humans themselves, with outcomes that we can barely begin to foresee.\n\nHumans will be designed through deliberate tinkering with our genetic makeup and deliberate bio-mechanical enhancements. These design changes will not only make humans healthier, smarter, longer-lived, more beautiful, but they may also make the new human less and less recognizable psychologically. All or our best and worst parts are motivated, at base, by instincts: instincts for love, hate, nurturing, aggression, compassion, collaboration, warfare.  Many of these were inherited from our primate and mammalian forebears, and then tinkered with by evolution over the last 200 thousand years.\n\nHuman 2.0 opens up the opportunity to rid ourselves of the worst human instincts and to enhance the best parts of humanity.  Human 2.0 may or may not have a sex drive, or an aggression drive. Recognizing that the Y chromosome is the most dangerous bit of genetic material known to mankind, it may be removed entirely. Human 2.0 might be sexless.\n\nThis book explores the almost infinite variation of possibilities that lies open to humankind as it stands on the threshold of being able to control its own genetic and bio-mechanical future.","created_at":"2015-06-14T18:45:50Z","height":141.0,"id":667,"parent_id":666,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-14T18:55:01Z","width":447.0},{"content":"Pathways","created_at":"2015-06-14T18:55:13Z","height":25.0,"id":668,"parent_id":665,"predecessor_id":676,"rank":0.75,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-14T19:08:33Z","width":64.0},{"content":"Sex","created_at":"2015-06-14T18:55:21Z","height":25.0,"id":669,"parent_id":668,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":672,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-14T18:57:41Z","width":24.0},{"content":"The Y chromosome is possibly the most dangerous snippet of genetic material known to man.","created_at":"2015-06-14T18:55:45Z","height":25.0,"id":670,"parent_id":669,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":671,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-14T18:56:06Z","width":376.0},{"content":"Human 2.0 may not have a sex drive, or even a sex.

Instead of actively and creatively engaging the team to improve itself, she seems to view the retrospective as a recipe that she goes through by rote. This is particularly evident when we discuss things that went wrong. Rather than asking probing questions and participating in brainstorming solutions, she hurries people to finish up so that we can get through all the topics, and she does not seem particularly interested in solving any of the problems that are raised.\n\nFor example, when Marina said that she had a hard time closing jiras this week because a long meeting had been scheduled on the last day of the sprint, Sarada explained why that meeting was necessary and then attempted to move to the next topic. I had to stop her and say: wait a minute, we haven't solved the problem. Let's see if there's something we can do to make Marina's life better.

We planned a very ambitious sprint, possibly the most difficult among the last 5 sprints, and, of those last 5 sprints, not one has completed at 100%. Despite that, people rated the probability as 80% or better that we would complete the next sprint at 100%.\n\nI am not sure whether people were being cynical or ignorant. If they did not believe what they were saying, then perhaps they just view this as a perfunctory ritual: you fill the sprint with whatever you want, then you raise your first with a 4 or 5, and the company lets you do what you want. Since there are no repercussions for being wrong, why not?\n\nIncidentally, I voted with 1/5. Given that in 5 sprints we have never completed 100%, 1/5 is actually a generous estimate.

We do this at least  at the end of every month, but it can be done as often as desired. This process helps us discover fraudulent transactions or, in rare cases, transactions we failed to record, since we no longer record transactions manually. It also helps us categorize transactions into expense categories so that we can keep track of where our money is going.\n\nCurrently, the reconciliation process mainly helps with the first and third objectives above. We no longer record transactions manually, except for cash transactions. Transactions from our checking account, savings account, chase visa card, etc., are downloaded by Quicken directly from the institution and then imported into Quicken. This saves a huge amount of manual data entry time.\n\nNOTE: Because we are downloading transactions and importing them directly into Quicken, a transfer between two such accounts is handled differently than it used to be. In the past, when doing manual entry, a transfer between two accounts would be represented as a single transaction in Quicken, with a “from” account and a “to” account. But, when downloading and importing transactions, a transfer is represented as two transactions: one for each account whose transaction data is downloaded. So don’t “clean up” a downloaded transfer transaction by specifying the other end of the transfer in its transaction record. This will only end up creating a duplicate entry when you download the transactions for the other account later on. Note, however, that if only *one* of the two accounts involved in a transfer is having its transactions downloaded, then you can and should “clean up” the downloaded transaction by specifying the other end of the transfer. For example, if you did an ATM withdrawal from checking to cash, the withdrawal from checking will be reflected in the checking account when you download its transactions, but the deposit into the cash account will not be. So you can and should go into the checking account in Quicken and clean up this transaction by specifying the cash account as the other end of the transfer.\n\nAfter the transactions are downloaded and imported into Quicken, we go through each new transaction in Quicken, properly categorize it, clean up any documentation errors (the imports from SFCU are often truncated in terms of their descriptions), and of course verify that the transaction seems to be valid.\n\nFinally, we use Quicken’s reconcile feature to verify that our Quicken balance matches the balance indicated by our financial institution. Because we are uploading their data, there should only be a discrepancy if we find we disagree with one of the charges. Discrepancies due to bad data entry or missing transactions should not longer be a problem.\n\nThe accounts to be reconciled are:\nSFCU Checking\nSFCU Premier Savings\nCornerstone Analytics\nChase Visa\nCash\n\nOther accounts that are not reconciled are:\nMacy’s\nPG&E\nATT\netc.  . . .\n\nMacy’s isn’t reconciled because the number of charges is small. We can eyeball those statements manually. But, to account for the expenses, the individual charges should be categorized. So, really, we should have a Macy’s account ledger in Quicken. Since we don’t, we should just categorize Macy’s as essential:household:misc.\n\nThe PG&E account isn’t reconciled because its charges all fall under a single expense category. We can eyeball the bill if the charges ever seem out-of-whack. Similarly for ATT, these are all phone charges. We can review the bill, but there’s nothing to reconcile against because we don’t have a Quicken account for it.","created_at":"2015-06-27T19:44:05Z","height":271.0,"id":1198,"parent_id":1197,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":1199,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-27T19:47:36Z","width":507.0},{"content":"Reconcile SFCU Checking","created_at":"2015-06-27T19:47:27Z","height":25.0,"id":1199,"parent_id":1197,"predecessor_id":1198,"rank":0.75,"successor_id":null,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-27T19:47:46Z","width":184.0},{"content":"Download transaction data from SFCU checking","created_at":"2015-06-27T19:48:01Z","height":25.0,"id":1200,"parent_id":1199,"predecessor_id":null,"rank":0.5,"successor_id":1202,"type_id":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-27T19:48:58Z","width":352.0},{"content":"Log in to SFCU using either Julie’s or Joshua’s member number. \nSelect the checking account. \nAt the bottom right of the page is an export button.
