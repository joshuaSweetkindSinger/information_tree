== Information Tree
An information tree is a place to store information about anything. 

Navigate the tree by expanding nodes of interest. You do this by clicking on the blue triangles to the left of the node.

Click left on a node to edit its text. Click right on a node to get a menu of options, which includes the ability to create child nodes or sibling nodes.

By organizing your information into a rational hierarchy, you can find anything quickly by descending the tree along the relevant path.
